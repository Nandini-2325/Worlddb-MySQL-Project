# Worlddb-MySQL-Project

## üìå 1. Project Overview
This project involves designing and populating a **relational database** that models global information such as **countries, cities, continents, and languages**.  
It serves as a foundation for developing **SQL querying skills**, analyzing real-world data, and simulating international reporting systems.

The database was built using **MySQL Workbench** for data modeling and **MySQL** for schema creation and data management.

## üõ† 2. Tools Used
| Tool                 | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| MySQL Workbench      | ER modeling and schema design (.mwb file)    |
| MySQL                | Query execution and database interaction     |
| SQL                  | Writing and testing relational queries       |
| Excel / CSV (optional)| Importing or exporting sample data           |

## üåê 3. Dataset Overview
The World database includes structured data on:  

- üåé **Countries** ‚Äì name, population, region, surface area, etc.  
- üèôÔ∏è **Cities** ‚Äì cities linked to countries with population and location  
- üó∫Ô∏è **Continents** ‚Äì global continent reference  
- üó£Ô∏è **Languages** ‚Äì languages spoken in each country and whether they are official  
- üíπ **Economy** ‚Äì GDP and economic indicators (optional expansion)  

This dataset simulates a **geopolitical and socio-economic model** used in global data analysis scenarios.

## üß± 4. Schema Overview
The schema includes the following **normalized tables**:

| Table       | Description                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **continent** | List of continents (e.g., Europe, Asia)                 |
| **country**   | Information about countries including population, area, continent reference |
| **city**      | Cities with foreign key link to country                  |
| **language**  | Languages spoken in countries, indicating if official   |
| **gdp_data** (optional) | Economic indicators like GDP, inflation           |

### üîó Relationships
- `country.continent_id ‚Üí continent.continent_id`  
- `city.country_id ‚Üí country.country_id`  
- `language.country_id ‚Üí country.country_id`

## üìö 5. Key Learnings
- üîß Modeled **real-world entities** in a normalized relational schema.  
- üìä Practiced **JOINs, aggregations, and filtering** across multiple tables.  
- üß© Applied **foreign keys** to maintain referential integrity.  
- üì• Gained experience with **data modeling tools** (MySQL Workbench .mwb).  
- üß† Simulated a practical dataset useful for **analysis, reporting, and dashboard projects**.
